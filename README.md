# ToDo-List-App
My first Ionic App with node.js as backend, Cordova framework and the Android Build is completed 

Hi.
This is my first Ionic App.


The server.js in the main directory acts as the backend server for this Ionic Application.
The API for this server can be found at https://polar-refuge-60046.herokuapp.com/


For running the ionic app on browser, simply change to ionicApp directory and type "ionic serve -w browser-name".
Browser name can be "chrome", "safari", etc.


There is also a completely built Android App in this repository. It's located in ionicApp/platforms/android directory.
To run the android app on Android Studio, simply open the Android Project in Android Studio, wait for the gradle build to complete which can take some time.
After the project opens on Android Studio, select the CleanAndRun option in the Run menubar.
I ran the application on a Nexus 5X Emulator running Android 7.1 Nougat.
